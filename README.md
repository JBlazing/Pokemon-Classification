# Pokeman-Classification

This was done for CIS 550 Advanced Machine Learning for the Fall 2018 Semester.

The project tries to classifiy a pokemon based off of its image presented to the algorithm.

Pictures were scrapped from Pokemondb using the PokeScrapper.py file.

The two methods used for classification were:
* Convolutional Neural Networks
* Multilayer perceptron

We where able to get a 50 % classification rate with 18 different pokemon types.
